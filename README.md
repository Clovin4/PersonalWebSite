 # Project: Personal Website

 ## Abstract: This is a sandbox type site where I can practice CSS, HTML, JS and anything else I see on the internet. 

 ### Adding emoji characters in HTML/CSS

 ```CSS
@counter-style emoji-1 {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols: "\1F4A9";
    suffix: " ";
}
 ```

 Here \1F4A9 corresponds to the desired poop emoji.
